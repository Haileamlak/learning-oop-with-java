This repository contains a collection of programs that I wrote while learning Java and exploring the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The programs range from basic Java syntax exercises to more complex implementations of OOP principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. Additionally, it includes several graphical user interface (GUI) applications that demonstrate Java's capabilities in building desktop applications.
